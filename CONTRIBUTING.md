## Ways to contribute

### Bug reports
You can submit bug reports on our GitHub repo

### Contributing code
We welcome contributions to the codebase. Here are some coding guidelines to follow:
* Where possible, we explicitly state the arg names when calling a function. 
  This makes refactoring easier. If possible, use `func(a=1, b=2)` rather than `func(1, 2)`

### Error usage
- Errors raised that concern non-user-facing functionality
(for example, related to vectors), should raise an `InternalError` or its subclass
- Errors arising from calls S2 Inference's API should raise an `S2InferenceError`    


### Semantic Versioning
We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). 
- We are in [major version 0 (0.x.x)](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4). Because of this, we may release major breaking changes by incrementing the minor version (0.2.4 -> 0.3.0) rather than the major version. 
- We do regular minor releases. These are releases that are additive and don't break existing functionality. These may additively extend the API. 
During a minor release we bump the patch number: 0.1.5 -> 0.1.6
- In-between minor releases, we release bug-fixes and optimisations where we optionally bump the patch number: 0.2.12 -> 0.2.13
- If there are any breaking changes, there will be a major release, recorded as incrementing the minor version: 0.2.4 -> 0.3.0
- Once Marqo is in major version 1 (1.0.0), the public API will be considered 'defined' and Marqo's versioning will follow the typical semantic versioning pattern
- If we are still in major version 0, and complexity and stability needs necessitates it, we can force all bug fixes and optimisations to increment the patch number
  (rather than it being optional). In this case this section will be updated to reflect the change.

### Releasing changes
- Run unit tests and ensure they all pass (read the testing section below for more details)
- Generate a pull request to the `mainline` branch. These will be reviewed before merging
- After merging to `mainline`, please delete the branch with the pull request
- A Github integration pipeline will run. After all tests pass, build a multiplatform docker image for the `linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64` platforms, pushing it to the
`marqoai/marqo` repository. Make sure it is tagged with the version number (`marqoai/marqo:0.1.5`)   
- For releases, please record changes in  `RELEASE.md`. Then create a 
[github release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) 
(with a short summary of changes) that links to the changes in `RELEASE.md`.
- For releases that change the API, update py-marqo to make those changes accessible. 
- To release a change to py-marqo, bump py-marqo's version (major.minor.patch, see below for more details), run all the tests, build the package and push to it PyPi. py-marqo's verson is independent from Marqo.  

- Then, use the following format for releasing changes:
  - . # Release x.y.z 
    - small blurb about release
  - . ## Breaking changes
  - . ## Deprecations
  - . ## Caveats 
    - adding/bumping of dependencies
    - lack of platform support (for certain features)
    - other (non-breaking) caveats to new features/fixes 
  - . ## New features
    - Non-breaking changes
  - . ##  Bug fixes 
  - . ### Testing

### Testing

WARNING: Be very careful if your environment has access to a Marqo production instance. These tests will arbitrarily modify, create and delete indices on the Marqo instances it uses for testing. 


__Tips__

If you don't have the exact python version specified in the `tox.ini` file, you can run tox like this: `tox -e py`. This tells `tox` to use whatever python version it finds on your machine.
#### Unit tests

1. Ensure you have marqo-os running:
```bash
docker rm -f marqo-os
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9600:9600 -e "discovery.type=single-node" --name marqo-os marqoai/marqo-os:0.0.2
```
2. run `tox` in the Marqo home directory

#### Integration  tests
To run integration tests, pull the [api testing repo](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests). 
Then, follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests#readme).


#### Testing Marqo python client
The Python Marqo client has its own test suite. Clone [the repo](https://github.com/marqo-ai/py-marqo), `cd` into the client home directory and then run `tox`.

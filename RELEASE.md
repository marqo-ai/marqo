# Release 0.1.0

## New features
- Telemetry. Marqo now includes various timing metrics for the `search`, `bulk_search` and `add_documents` endpoints
when the query parameter `telemetry=True` is specified (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/506). The metrics will be
returned in the response body and provide a breakdown of latencies for various stages of the API call.
- Consolidate default device to CUDA when available (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/508). By default,
Marqo now uses CUDA devices for search and indexing if available.
See [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.1.0/API-Reference/search/#query-parameters) for more information. This helps ensure
you get the best indexing and search experience without having to explicitly add the device parameter to search and
add_documents calls.
- Model download integrity verification (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/502). Model files are validated and
removed if corrupted during download. This helps ensure that models are not loaded if they are corrupted.

## Breaking changes
- Remove deprecated `add_or_update_documents` endpoint (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/517).
- Disable automatic index creation. Marqo will no longer automatically create an index if it does not exist 
(https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/516).
Attempting to add documents to a non-existent index will now result in an error. This helps provide more certainty about
the properties of the index you are adding documents to, and also helps prevent accidental indexing to the wrong index.
- Remove parallel indexing (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/523). Marqo no longer supports server-side parallel
indexing. This helps deliver a more stable and efficient indexing experience. Parallelisation can still be implemented
by the user.

## Bug fixes and minor changes
- Improve error messages (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/494, https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/499).
- Improve API request validation (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/495).
- Add new multimodal search example (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/503).
- Remove autocast for CPU to speed up vectorisation on ARM64 machines (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/491).
- Enhance test stability (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/514).
- Ignore `.kibana` index (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/512).
- Improve handling of whitespace when indexing documents (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/521).
- Update CUDA version to 11.4.3 (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/525).

  from Hugging Face and AWS s3 via the `model_location` settings object and `model_auth`. 
  See [here (model auth during search)](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.19/API-Reference/search/#model-auth)
  and [here (model auth during add_documents)](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.19/API-Reference/documents/#model-auth) for usage.
- Max replicas configuration (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/465). 
  Marqo admins now have more control over the max number of replicas that can be set for indexes on the Marqo instance.
  See [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.19/Advanced-Usage/configuration/#configuring-usage-limits) for how to configure this.

## Breaking changes
- Marqo now allows for a maximum of 1 replica per index by default (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/465).

## Bug fixes and minor changes
- README improvements (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/468)

# Release 0.0.18

## New features
- New E5 model type is available (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/419). E5 models are state of the art general-purpose text embedding models that obtained the best results on the MTEB benchmark when released in Dec 2022. Read more about these models [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.18/Models-Reference/dense_retrieval/#text).
- Automatic model ejection (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/372). Automatic model ejection helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors on machines with a larger amount of CPU memory (16GB+) by ejecting the least recently used model. 
- Speech processing article and example (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/431). [@OwenPendrighElliott](https://github.com/OwenPendrighElliott) demonstrates how you can build and query a Marqo index from audio clips. 

## Optimisations 
- Delete optimisation (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/436). The `/delete` endpoint can now handle a higher volume of requests.
- Inference calls can now execute in batches, with batch size configurable by an environment variable (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/376).

## Bug fixes and minor changes
- Configurable max value validation for HNSW graph parameters (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/424). See [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.18/Advanced-Usage/configuration/#other-configurations) for how to configure.
- Configurable maximum number of tensor search attributes (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/430). See [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.18/Advanced-Usage/configuration/#other-configurations) for how to configure.
- Unification of vectorise output type (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/432)
- Improved test pipeline reliability (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/438, https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/439)
- Additional image download tests (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/402, https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/442)
- Minor fix in the Iron Manual example (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/440)

# Release 0.0.17 

## New features
- New parameters that allow tweaking of Marqo indexes' underlying HNSW graph. `ef_construction` and `m`  can be defined at index time (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/386, https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/420, https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/421), giving you more control over the relevancy/speed tradeoff. See usage and more details [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.17/API-Reference/indexes/#example_1).
- Score modification fields (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/414). Rank documents using knn similarity in addition to document metadata ( https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/414). This allows integer or float fields from a document to bias a document's score during the knn search and allows additional ranking signals to be used. Use cases include giving more reputable documents higher weighting and de-duplicating search results. See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.17/API-Reference/search/#score-modifiers).

## Bug fixes and minor changes
- Added validation for unknown parameters during bulk search (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/413).
- Improved concurrency handling when adding documents to an index as it's being deleted (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/407).
- Better error messages for multimodal combination fields (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/395).
- Examples of recently added features added to README (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/403).

## Release 0.0.16

## New features
- Bulk search (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/363, https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/373). 
Conduct multiple searches with just one request. This improves search throughput in Marqo by parallelising multiple search queries in a single API call. 
The average search time can be decreased up to 30%, depending on your devices and models. 
Check out the usage guide [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.16/API-Reference/bulk)
- Configurable number of index replicas (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/391). 
You can now configure how many replicas to make for an index in Marqo using the `number_of_replicas` parameter. Marqo makes 1 replica by default.
We recommend having at least one replica to prevent data loss.
See the usage guide [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.16/API-Reference/indexes/#body-parameters)
- Use your own vectors during searches (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/381). Use your own vectors as context for your queries. 
Your vectors will be incorporated into the query using a weighted sum approach, 
allowing you to reduce the number of inference requests for duplicated content.
Check out the usage guide [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.16/API-Reference/search/#context)

## Bug fixes and minor changes
- Fixed a bug where some Open CLIP models were unable to load checkpoints from the cache (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/387).
- Fixed a bug where multimodal search vectors are not combined based on expected weights (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/384).
- Fixed a bug where multimodal document vectors are not combined in an expected way. `numpy.sum` was used rather than `numpy.mean`.  (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/384).
- Fixed a bug where an unexpected error is thrown when `using_existing_tensor = True` and documents are added with duplicate IDs (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/390).
- Fixed a bug where the index settings validation did not catch the `model` field if it is in the incorrect part of the settings json (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/365).
- Added missing descriptions and requirement files on our [GPT-examples](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/tree/mainline/examples/GPT-examples) (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/349).  
- Updated the instructions to start Marqo-os (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/371).
- Improved the Marqo start-up time by incorporating the downloading of the punkt tokenizer into the dockerfile (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/346).

that added missing descriptions and requirement files on our [GPT-examples](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/tree/mainline/examples/GPT-examples).

# Release 0.0.15

## New features 
- Multimodal tensor combination (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/332, https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/355). Combine image and text data into a single vector! Multimodal combination objects can be added as Marqo document fields. For example, this can be used to encode text metadata into image vectors. See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.15/Advanced-Usage/document_fields/#multimodal-combination-object).

## Bug fixes
- Fixed a bug that prevented CLIP's device check from behaving as expected (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/337)
- CLIP utils is set to use the OpenCLIP default tokenizer so that long text inputs are truncated correctly (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/351).

# Release 0.0.14

## New features 
- `use_existing_tensors` flag, for `add_documents` (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/335). Use existing Marqo tensors to autofill unchanged tensor fields, for existing documents. This lets you quickly add new metadata while minimising inference operations. See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.14/API-Reference/documents/#query-parameters).
- `image_download_headers` parameter for `search` and `add_documents` (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/336). Index and search non-publicly available images. Add image download auth information to `add_documents` and `search` requests. See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.14/API-Reference/image_downloads/).

## Optimisations
- The index cache is now updated on intervals of 2 seconds (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/333), rather than on every search. This reduces the pressure on Marqo-OS, allowing for greater search and indexing throughput. 

## Bug fixes
- Helpful validation errors for invalid index settings (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/330). Helpful error messages allow for a smoother getting-started experience. 
- Automatic precision conversion to `fp32` when using `fp16` models on CPU (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/331). 
- Broadening of the types of image download errors gracefully handled. (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/321)


# Release 0.0.13

## New features
- Support for custom CLIP models using the OpenAI and OpenCLIP architectures (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/286). Read about usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.13/Models-Reference/dense_retrieval/#generic-clip-models).
- Concurrency throttling (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/304). Configure the number of allowed concurrent indexing and search threads. Read about usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.13/Advanced-Usage/configuration/#configuring-throttling).
- Configurable logging levels (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/314). Adjust log output for your debugging/log storage needs. See how to configure log level [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.13/Advanced-Usage/configuration/#configuring-log-level).
- New array datatype (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/312). You can use these arrays as a collection of tags to filter on! See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.13/Advanced-Usage/document_fields/#array).
- Boost tensor fields during search (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/300). Weight fields as higher and lower relative to each other during search. Use this to get a mix of results that suits your use case. See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.13/API-Reference/search/#boost).
- Weighted multimodal queries (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/307). You can now search with a dictionary of weighted queries. If searching an image index, these queries can be a weighted mix of image URLs and text. See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.13/API-Reference/search/#query-q).
- New GPT-Marqo integration [example](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/tree/mainline/examples/GPT-examples) and [article](https://www.marqo.ai/blog/from-iron-manual-to-ironman-augmenting-gpt-with-marqo-for-fast-editable-memory-to-enable-context-aware-question-answering). Turn your boring user manual into a question-answering bot, with an optional persona, with GPT + Marqo!
- Added new OpenCLIP models to Marqo (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/299)

## Optimisations
- Concurrent image downloads (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/281, https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/311)
- Blazingly fast `fp16` ViT CLIP models (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/286). See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.13/Models-Reference/dense_retrieval/#openai-float16)
- Reduction of data transfer between Marqo and Marqo-os (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/300)
- We see a 3.0x indexing speedup, and a 1.7x search speedup, using the new `fp16/ViT-L/14` CLIP model, compared to the previous release using `ViT-L/14`.  

## Bug fixes 
- Fixed 500 error when creating an index while only specifying `number_of_shards`(https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/293)
- Fixed model cache management no parsing reranker model properties properly (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/308)

- The `/models` endpoint (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/239). View what models are loaded, and on what device. This lets Marqo admins examine loaded models and prune unneeded ones. See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.11/API-Reference/models/)
- The `/device` endpoint (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/239). See resource usage for the machine Marqo is running on. This helps Marqo admins manage resources on remote Marqo instances. See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.11/API-Reference/device/)
- The index settings endpoint (`/indexes/{index_name}/settings`)(https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/248). See the model and parameters used by each index. See usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.11/API-Reference/settings/). 
- Latency log outputs (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/242). Marqo admins have better transparency about the latencies for each step of the Marqo indexing and search request pipeline
- ONNX CLIP models are now available (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/245). Index and search images in Marqo with CLIP models in the faster, and open, ONNX format - created by Marqo's machine learning team. These ONNX CLIP models give Marqo up to a 35% speedup over standard CLIP models. These ONNX CLIP models are open sourced by Marqo. Read about usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/0.0.11/Models-Reference/dense_retrieval/#onnx-clip).
- New simple [image search](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/blob/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/ImageSearchGuide.md) guide (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/253, https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/263).

# Release 0.0.9
## Optimisations 
- Set k to limit to for Marqo-os search queries (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/219)
- Reduced the amount of metadata returned from Marqo-os, on searches (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/218)

## Non-breaking data model changes
- Set default kNN m value to 16 (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/222)

## Bug fixes
- Better error messages when downloading an image fails (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/198)
- Bug where filtering wouldn't work on fields with spaces (https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/213), resolving https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/issues/115


# Release 0.0.8

## New features
- Get indexes endpoint: `GET /indexes` ([#181](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/181)). Use this endpoint to inspect
existing Marqo indexes. 
Read about usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/API-Reference/indexes/#list-indexes).
- Non-tensor fields([#161](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/161)). 
During the indexing phase, mark fields as non-tensor to prevent tensors being created for them. 
This helps speed up indexing and reduce storage for fields where keyword search is good enough. For example: email, name 
and categorical fields. These fields can still be used for filtering. 
Read about usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/API-Reference/documents/#query-parameters).
- Configurable preloaded models([#155](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/155)).
Specify which machine learning model to load as Marqo starts. This prevents a delay during initial search and index commands after 
Marqo starts. Read about usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/Advanced-Usage/configuration/#preloading-models).
- New [example](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/tree/mainline/examples/GPT3NewsSummary) 
and [article](https://medium.com/creator-fund/building-search-engines-that-think-like-humans-e019e6fb6389):

# Release 0.0.7

## Bug fixes and minor changes
- 429 (too many request errors) are propagated from Marqo-os to the user properly ([#150](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/150))

# Release 0.0.6

## New features
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health`. An endpoint that can be used to inspect the status of Marqo and Marqo's backend (Marqo-os) 
([#128](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/128)). Read about usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/API-Reference/health/).
- Marqo can be launched with environment variables that define limits around maximum number of fields per index, maximum document size and the maximum number of documents that can be retrieved 
([#135](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/135)). Read about usage [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/Advanced-Usage/configuration/).
- README translations:

  - Polish 🇵🇱 (by [@MichalLuck](https://github.com/MichalLuck), [#136](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/136))
  - Ukrainian 🇺🇦 (by [@dmyzlata](https://github.com/dmyzlata), [#138](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/138))
  - French 🇫🇷 (by [@rym-oualha](https://github.com/rym-oualha), [#147](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/147))

## Breaking API changes
- The home `/` json response has been updated. If you have logic that reads the endpoint root, please update it ([#128](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/128)). 
- The Python client's `add_documents()` and `update_documents()` `batch_size` parameter has been replaced by `server_batch_size` and `client_batch_size` parameters 
([py-marqo#27](https://github.com/marqo-ai/py-marqo/pull/27)), ([py-marqo#28](https://github.com/marqo-ai/py-marqo/pull/28))

## Non-breaking data model changes
- Each text field just creates a top level Marqo-os text field, without any keywords 
([#135](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/135))
- Very large fields get their tensor_facet keywords ignored, rather than Marqo-OS preventing the doc being indexed
([#135](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/135))
- Tensor facets can no longer have _id as a filtering field
([#135](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/135))

## Bug fixes and minor changes
- FastAPI runs with better concurrency ([#128](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/pull/128))
- Get documents by IDs and lexical search and no longer returns vectors if expose_facets isn't specified
- Fixed batching bug in Python client
([py-marqo#28](https://github.com/marqo-ai/py-marqo/pull/28))

## Caveats
- If a large request to add_documents or update_documents results in a document adding fields such that the index field limit is exceeded, the entire operation will fail (without resilience). Mitigate this sending `add_documents` and `update_documents` requests with smaller batches of documents. 
- For optimal indexing of large volumes of images, we recommend that the images are hosted on the same region and cloud provider as Marqo.

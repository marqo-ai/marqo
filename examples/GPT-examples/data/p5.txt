Cleaning
Clean the upper part of iron with a damp cloth. If
necessary, use a mild detergent.
Do not use alcohol, acetone, benzene, scourging
cleaning agents, etc., to clean the iron. Do not use
hard brushes or metallic objects.
Remove any deposits on the soleplate with a damp
cloth. To avoid scratching the finishing, never use
metallic pad to clean the soleplate, and never place
the iron on a rough surface.
To remove synthetic residue from the soleplate, iron
over an old cotton rag in high setting.
Always store the emptied iron horizontally on a
stable surface with a cloth protecting the soleplate.
Self-clean function
The self-cleaning function should be used on a regular
basis, depending on usage and the hardness of water
used.
WARNING: Never pour white vinegar or any liquid
cleaners into the water tank!
Fill the water tank. Refer to OPERATION: Filling the
water tank.
Position the iron vertically on its stand on a suitable
surface.
Ensure that the steam control (D) is in OFF position.

Set to maximum ironing temperature.
Once the soleplate temperature is reached, unplug
the iron from mains power.
Hold the iron over a sink (away from your body),
pressand hold the steam control (D) at "CALC CLEAN"
position. Boiling water and steam will now emit from
the holes in soleplate.

allow any scale and other deposits being expelled
with the boiling water and the steam.
Release the CALC CLEAN button when the water tank
is empty.
Plug the appliance into a mains power outlet socket,
set a temperature and leave in operation for at least

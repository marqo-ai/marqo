IRONING TIPS
IMPORTANT! always check whether a label with ironing instructions is attached to the garment. Always
follow the ironing instructions attached to the garment.
The iron heats up quicker than it cools down, therefore, you should start ironing the articles requiring the
lowest temperature such as those made of synthetic fibre.
If the fabric consists of various kinds of fibres, you must always select the lowest ironing temperature to
iron the composition of those fibres.
Silk and other fabrics that are likely to become shiny should always be ironed on the inner side. To prevent
staining, do not spray water straight on silk or other delicate fabrics.
To prevent staining, do not spray water straight on silk or other delicate fabrics.
Velvet and other textures that rapidly become shiny should be ironed in one direction with light pressure
applied. Always keep the iron moving at any moment.
Pure wool fabrics (100% wool) may be ironed with the iron set to steam position. Preferably set steam
button to the maximum position and use a dry cloth between the garment and the iron for protection.
Do not touch plastic buttons with a hot iron because they may melt.
Be careful around zippers and similar items to prevent the soleplate from scratching.

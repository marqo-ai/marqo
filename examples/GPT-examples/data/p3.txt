BEFORE FIRST USE
Unpack the appliance and check if all parts are there
and undamaged. Should this not be the case, return the
product to Kmart for replacement.
The packaging contains:
One steam iron
One filler cup
Clean all parts before first use. See Cleaning and
Maintenance
Heat up the iron to its maximum temperature and iron
over a piece of damp cloth for several minutes. This will
burn-off any manufacturing residue from the iron.
Smoke and odour may occur for a short period during
this process, which is normal.
FEATURES
Your iron has an Anti-Drip system, Anti-Scales system
and Auto-Off function.
Anti-Drip system: This is to prevent water from escaping
from the soleplate when the iron is cold. During use, the
anti-drip system may emit a loud 'clicking' sound,
particularly when heating up or cooling down. This is
normal and indicates that the system is functioning
correctly.
Anti-Scale system: The built-in anti-scale cartridge is
designed to reduce the build-up of lime scale which
occurs during steam ironing and will prolong the
working life of your iron. The anti-calc cartridge is an
integral part of the water tank and does not need to be
replaced.
Auto-Off function: This feature automatically switches
off the steam iron if it has not been moved for a while.

    appliance and that the power outlet has an earth
    connection. If unsure check with an electrician.
    Ensure before each use that the supply cord or any
    other parts are not damaged.
    Keep the iron and its cord out of reach of children
    when connected to mains power or cooling down.
    Never direct the steam towards persons or animals.
    Never direct the steam jet towards any other
    electrical or/and electronic appliances.

    IMPORTANT! This iron must not be left unattended
    while it is connected to mains power and before it
    has cooled down. The soleplate of the iron can
    become extremely hot and may cause burns if
    touched.
    Do not unplug the appliance by pulling on the cord
    or on the appliance.
    Never immerse the iron, the stand, the power cord
    or the plug in water. Never hold them under a water
    tap.
    Do not allow the supply cord to come in contact with
    the soleplate when the iron is hot.
    If the supply cord is damaged, it must be replaced by
    qualified electrical person only or the product must
    be disposed.
    Disconnect from mains power when filling the
    reservoir in the iron with water.
    The iron must be used and rested on a flat, stable
    surface.
    Always place and operate the iron on a flat, solid,
    clean and dry surface. When placing the iron on its
    stand, ensure that the surface on which the stand is
    placed is stable.
    For additional protection, this appliance should be
    connected to a household residual current device

    BEFORE FIRST USE
    Unpack the appliance and check if all parts are there
    and undamaged. Should this not be the case, return the
    product to Kmart for replacement.
    The packaging contains:
    One steam iron
    One filler cup
    Clean all parts before first use. See Cleaning and
    Maintenance
    Heat up the iron to its maximum temperature and iron
    over a piece of damp cloth for several minutes. This will
    burn-off any manufacturing residue from the iron.
    Smoke and odour may occur for a short period during
    this process, which is normal.
    FEATURES
    Your iron has an Anti-Drip system, Anti-Scales system
    and Auto-Off function.
    Anti-Drip system: This is to prevent water from escaping
    from the soleplate when the iron is cold. During use, the
    anti-drip system may emit a loud 'clicking' sound,
    particularly when heating up or cooling down. This is
    normal and indicates that the system is functioning
    correctly.
    Anti-Scale system: The built-in anti-scale cartridge is
    designed to reduce the build-up of lime scale which
    occurs during steam ironing and will prolong the
    working life of your iron. The anti-calc cartridge is an
    integral part of the water tank and does not need to be
    replaced.
    Auto-Off function: This feature automatically switches
    off the steam iron if it has not been moved for a while.

    Filling the water tank
    Ensure that the iron is cold and not connected to a
    power supply.
    Open the water filling cover (C). Hold the iron in a
    tilted position and fill the tank with plain water,
    using the filler cup.
    DO NOT exceed the max level on the tank.
    Close the water filling cover (C) by pressing down the
    cap until you hear a 'click'. To avoid water spillage,
    ensure that the water tank is properly closed.
    NOTES:
    To avoid calcium deposits, we recommend you use
    distilled water for your steam iron.
    To avoid damage or blockage of your steam iron, do not
    use any scented water or additives.
    Steam Ironing
    Your steam iron is equipped with the Eco Steam System.
    This function offers 3 steam levels for optimal ironing:
    ECO: Reduced amount of steam for energy saving,
    suitable for most fabric types
    Normal steam :suitable for most fabric types
    Power steam :increased steam output for remove
    stubborn creases
    Fill the water tank with plain water.
    Position the iron vertically on its stand on a suitable
    flat stable surface.

    CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE
    Unplug the iron from mains power and allow it to cool
    completely before cleaning and storing.

    Cleaning
    Clean the upper part of iron with a damp cloth. If
    necessary, use a mild detergent.
    Do not use alcohol, acetone, benzene, scourging
    cleaning agents, etc., to clean the iron. Do not use
    hard brushes or metallic objects.
    Remove any deposits on the soleplate with a damp
    cloth. To avoid scratching the finishing, never use
    metallic pad to clean the soleplate, and never place
    the iron on a rough surface.
    To remove synthetic residue from the soleplate, iron
    over an old cotton rag in high setting.
    Always store the emptied iron horizontally on a
    stable surface with a cloth protecting the soleplate.
    Self-clean function
    The self-cleaning function should be used on a regular
    basis, depending on usage and the hardness of water
    used.
    WARNING: Never pour white vinegar or any liquid
    cleaners into the water tank!
    Fill the water tank. Refer to OPERATION: Filling the
    water tank.
    Position the iron vertically on its stand on a suitable
    surface.
    Ensure that the steam control (D) is in OFF position.
    Connect the plug to a suitable mains power outlet.
    Set to maximum ironing temperature.
    Once the soleplate temperature is reached, unplug
    the iron from mains power.
    Hold the iron over a sink (away from your body),
    pressand hold the steam control (D) at "CALC CLEAN"
    position. Boiling water and steam will now emit from

    IRONING TIPS
    IMPORTANT! always check whether a label with ironing instructions is attached to the garment. Always
    follow the ironing instructions attached to the garment.
    The iron heats up quicker than it cools down, therefore, you should start ironing the articles requiring the
    lowest temperature such as those made of synthetic fibre.
    If the fabric consists of various kinds of fibres, you must always select the lowest ironing temperature to
    iron the composition of those fibres.
    Silk and other fabrics that are likely to become shiny should always be ironed on the inner side. To prevent
    staining, do not spray water straight on silk or other delicate fabrics.
    To prevent staining, do not spray water straight on silk or other delicate fabrics.
    Velvet and other textures that rapidly become shiny should be ironed in one direction with light pressure
    applied. Always keep the iron moving at any moment.
    Pure wool fabrics (100% wool) may be ironed with the iron set to steam position. Preferably set steam
    button to the maximum position and use a dry cloth between the garment and the iron for protection.
    Do not touch plastic buttons with a hot iron because they may melt.
    Be careful around zippers and similar items to prevent the soleplate from scratching.

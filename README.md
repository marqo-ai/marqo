## Marqo

Marqo is more than a vector database, it's an end-to-end vector search engine for both text and images. Vector generation, storage and retrieval are handled out of the box through a single API. No need to bring your own embeddings. 
    
**Why Marqo?**

Vector similarity alone is not enough for vector search. Vector search requires more than a vector database - it also requires machine learning (ML) deployment and management, preprocessing and transformations of inputs as well as the ability to modify search behavior without retraining a model. Marqo contains all these pieces, enabling developers to build vector search into their application with minimal effort. A full list of features can be found [below](#-core-features).

**Why not X, Y, Z vector database?** 

Vector databases are specialized components for vector similarity and only service one component of a vector search system. They are ‚Äúvectors in - vectors out‚Äù. They still require the production of vectors, management of the ML models, associated orchestration and processing of the inputs. Marqo makes this easy by being ‚Äúdocuments in, documents out‚Äù. Preprocessing of text and images, embedding the content, storing meta-data and deployment of inference and storage is all taken care of by Marqo. 

**Quick start** 

Here is a code snippet for a minimal example of vector search with Marqo (see [Getting Started](#getting-started)):

1. Use docker to run Marqo:

```bash

docker rm -f marqo
docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
docker run --name marqo -it -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest

```

Note: If your `marqo` container keeps getting killed, this is most likely due to a lack of memory being allocated to Docker. Increasing the memory limit for Docker to at least 6GB (8GB recommended) in your Docker settings may fix the problem.

2. Install the Marqo client:

```bash
pip install marqo
```

3. Start indexing and searching! Let's look at a simple example below:

```python
import marqo

mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

mq.create_index("my-first-index")

mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
    {
        "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
        "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
    }, 
    {
        "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
        "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                       "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
        "_id": "article_591"
    }],
    tensor_fields=["Description"]
)

results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
    q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
)

```

## Getting started


1. Marqo requires docker. To install Docker go to the [Docker Official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Ensure that docker has at least 8GB memory and 50GB storage.

2. Use docker to run Marqo:

```bash

docker rm -f marqo
docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
docker run --name marqo -it --privileged -p 8882:8882 --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway marqoai/marqo:latest

```

Note: If your `marqo` container keeps getting killed, this is most likely due to a lack of memory being allocated to Docker. Increasing the memory limit for Docker to at least 6GB (8GB recommended) in your Docker settings may fix the problem.

3. Install the Marqo client:

```bash
pip install marqo
```

4. Start indexing and searching! Let's look at a simple example below:

```python
import marqo

mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

mq.create_index("my-first-index")

mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
    {
        "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
        "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
    }, 
    {
        "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
        "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                       "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
        "_id": "article_591"
    }],
    tensor_fields=["Description"]
)

results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
    q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
)

```

- `mq` is the client that wraps the `marqo` API.
- `create_index()` creates a new index with default settings. You have the option to specify what model to use. For example, `mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/all_datasets_v4_MiniLM-L6")` will create an index with the default text model `hf/all_datasets_v4_MiniLM-L6`. Experimentation with different models is often required to achieve the best retrieval for your specific use case. Different models also offer a tradeoff between inference speed and relevancy. See [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/1.0.0/Models-Reference/dense_retrieval/) for the full list of models.
- `add_documents()` takes a list of documents, represented as python dicts for indexing.
- You can optionally set a document's ID with the special `_id` field. Otherwise, Marqo will generate one.

Let's have a look at the results:

```python
# let's print out the results:
import pprint
pprint.pprint(results)

{
    'hits': [
        {
            'Title': 'Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)',
            'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and'
                           'communications for astronauts',
            '_highlights': [{
                'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, '
                               'mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts'
            }],
            '_id': 'article_591',
            '_score': 0.61938936
        },
        {
            'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo',
            'Description': "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels",
            '_highlights': [{'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo'}],
            '_id': 'e00d1a8d-894c-41a1-8e3b-d8b2a8fce12a',
            '_score': 0.60237324
        }
    ],
    'limit': 10,
    'processingTimeMs': 49,
    'query': 'What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?'
}
```

- Each hit corresponds to a document that matched the search query.
- They are ordered from most to least matching.
- `limit` is the maximum number of hits to be returned. This can be set as a parameter during search.
- Each hit has a `_highlights` field. This was the part of the document that matched the query the best.

## Other basic operations

### Get document

Retrieve a document by ID.

```python

result = mq.index("my-first-index").get_document(document_id="article_591")

```

Note that by adding the document using ```add_documents``` again using the same ```_id``` will cause a document to be updated.

### Get index stats

Get information about an index.

```python

results = mq.index("my-first-index").get_stats()

```

### Lexical search

Perform a keyword search.

```python

result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('marco polo', search_method=marqo.SearchMethods.LEXICAL)

```

### Multi modal and cross modal search

To power image and text search, Marqo allows users to plug and play with CLIP models from HuggingFace. **Note that if you do not configure multi modal search, image urls will be treated as strings.** To start indexing and searching with images, first create an index with a CLIP configuration, as below:

```python

settings = {
    "treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images":True,   # allows us to find an image file and index it 
    "model":"ViT-L/14"
}
response = mq.create_index("my-multimodal-index", **settings)

```

Images can then be added within documents as follows. You can use urls from the internet (for example S3) or from the disk of the machine:

```python

response = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").add_documents([{
    "My_Image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_realistic.png",
    "Description": "The hippopotamus, also called the common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa",
    "_id": "hippo-facts"
}], tensor_fields=["My_Image"])

```

You can then search the image field using text.

```python

results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal')

```

### Searching using an image
Searching using an image can be achieved by providing the image link.

```python

results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_statue.png')

```

### Searching using weights in queries
Queries can also be provided as dictionaries where each key is a query and their corresponding values are weights. This allows for more advanced queries consisting of multiple components with weightings towards or against them, queries can have negations via negative weighting.

The example below shows the application of this to a scenario where a user may want to ask a question but also negate results that match a certain semantic criterion. 

```python

import marqo
import pprint

mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

mq.create_index("my-weighted-query-index")

mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").add_documents(
    [
        {
            "Title": "Smartphone",
            "Description": "A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone "
            "functions and computing functions into one unit.",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Telephone",
            "Description": "A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to"
            "conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly.",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Thylacine",
            "Description": "The thylacine, also commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, "
            "is an extinct carnivorous marsupial."
            "The last known of its species died in 1936.",
        }
    ],
    tensor_fields=["Description"]
)

# initially we ask for a type of communications device which is popular in the 21st century
query = {
    # a weighting of 1.1 gives this query slightly more importance
    "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.1,
    # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
    "Technology that became prevelant in the 21st century": 1.0
}

results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

print("Query 1:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# now we ask for a type of communications which predates the 21st century
query = {
    # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
    "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.0,
    # a weighting of -1 gives this query a negation effect
    "Technology that became prevelant in the 21st century": -1.0
}

results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

print("\nQuery 2:")
pprint.pprint(results)

```

### Creating and searching indexes with multimodal combination fields
Marqo lets you have indexes with multimodal combination fields. Multimodal combination fields can combine text and images into one field. This allows scoring of documents across the combined text and image fields together. It also allows for a single vector representation instead of needing many which saves on storage. The relative weighting of each component can be set per document.

The example below demonstrates this with retrieval of caption and image pairs using multiple types of queries.

```python

import marqo
import pprint

mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

settings = {"treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images": True, "model": "ViT-L/14"}

mq.create_index("my-first-multimodal-index", **settings)

mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").add_documents(
    [
        {
            "Title": "Flying Plane",
            "caption": "An image of a passenger plane flying in front of the moon.",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image2.jpg",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Red Bus",
            "caption": "A red double decker London bus traveling to Aldwych",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image4.jpg",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Horse Jumping",
            "caption": "A person riding a horse over a jump in a competition.",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image1.jpg",
        },
    ],
    # Create the mappings, here we define our captioned_image mapping 
    # which weights the image more heavily than the caption - these pairs 
    # will be represented by a single vector in the index
    mappings={
        "captioned_image": {
            "type": "multimodal_combination",
            "weights": {
                "caption": 0.3,
                "image": 0.7
            }
        }
    },
    # We specify which fields to create vectors for. 
    # Note that captioned_image is treated as a single field.
    tensor_fields=["captioned_image"]
)

# Search this index with a simple text query
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q="Give me some images of vehicles and modes of transport. I am especially interested in air travel and commercial aeroplanes."
)

print("Query 1:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# search the index with a query that uses weighted components
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q={
        "What are some vehicles and modes of transport?": 1.0,
        "Aeroplanes and other things that fly": -1.0
    },
)
print("\nQuery 2:")
pprint.pprint(results)

results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q={"Animals of the Perissodactyla order": -1.0}
)
print("\nQuery 3:")
pprint.pprint(results)

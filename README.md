## Getting started

1. Marqo requires docker. To install Docker go to the [Docker Official website.]([https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)). Ensure that docker has at least 8gb memory and 50gb storage.

2. Use docker to run Marqo (Mac users with M-series chips will need to [go here](#m-series-mac-users)):

```bash

docker rm -f marqo;

docker pull marqoai/marqo:0.0.6;

docker run --name marqo -it --privileged -p 8882:8882 --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway marqoai/marqo:0.0.6

```

3. Install the Marqo client:

```bash

pip install marqo

```

4. Start indexing and searching! Let's look at a simple example below:

```python

import marqo

mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([

{

"Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",

"Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"

},

{

"Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",

"Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "

"mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",

"_id": "article_591"

}]

)

results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(

q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"

)

```

- `mq` is the client that wraps the `marqo` API
- `add_documents()` takes a list of documents, represented as python dicts, for indexing
- `add_documents()` creates an index with default settings, if one does not already exist
- You can optionally set a document's ID with the special `_id` field. Otherwise, Marqo will generate one.
- If the index doesn't exist, Marqo will create it. If it exists then Marqo will add the documents to the index.

Let's have a look at the results:

```python

# let's print out the results:

import pprint

pprint.pprint(results)

{

'hits': [

{

'Title': 'Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)',

'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and'

'communications for astronauts',

'_highlights': {

'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, '

'mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts'

},

'_id': 'article_591',

'_score': 0.61938936

},

{

'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo',

'Description': "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels",

'_highlights': {'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo'},

'_id': 'e00d1a8d-894c-41a1-8e3b-d8b2a8fce12a',

'_score': 0.60237324

}

],

'limit': 10,

'processingTimeMs': 49,

'query': 'What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?'

}

```

- Each hit corresponds to a document that matched the search query
- They are ordered from most to least matching
- `limit` is the maximum number of hits to be returned. This can be set as a parameter during search
- Each hit has a `_highlights` field. This was the part of the document that matched the query the best

## Other basic operations

### Get document

Retrieve a document by ID.

```python

result = mq.index("my-first-index").get_document(document_id="article_591")

```

Note that by adding the document using ```add_documents``` again using the same ```_id``` will cause a document to be updated.

### Get index stats

Get information about an index.

```python

results = mq.index("my-first-index").get_stats()

```

### Lexical search

Perform a keyword search.

```python

result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('marco polo', search_method=marqo.SearchMethods.LEXICAL)

```

### Search specific fields

Using the default tensor search method

```python

result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('adventure', searchable_attributes=['Title'])

```

### Delete documents

Delete documents.

```python

results = mq.index("my-first-index").delete_documents(ids=["article_591", "article_602"])

```

### Delete index

Delete an index.

```python

results = mq.index("my-first-index").delete()

```

## Multi modal and cross modal search

To power image and text search, Marqo allows users to plug and play with CLIP models from HuggingFace. **Note that if you do not configure multi modal search, image urls will be treated as strings.** To start indexing and searching with images, first create an index with a CLIP configuration, as below:

```python

settings = {

"treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images":True, # allows us to find an image file and index it

"model":"ViT-L/14"

}

response = mq.create_index("my-multimodal-index", **settings)

```

Images can then be added within documents as follows. You can use urls from the internet (for example S3) or from the disk of the machine:

```python

response = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").add_documents([{

"My Image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Portrait_Hippopotamus_in_the_water.jpg/440px-Portrait_Hippopotamus_in_the_water.jpg",

"Description": "The hippopotamus, also called the common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa",

"_id": "hippo-facts"

}])

```

You can then search using text as usual. Both text and image fields will be searched:

```python

results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal')

```

Setting `searchable_attributes` to the image field `['My Image'] ` ensures only images are searched in this index:

```python

results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal', searchable_attributes=['My Image'])

```

### Searching using an image

Searching using an image can be achieved by providing the image link.

```python

results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Standing_Hippopotamus_MET_DP248993.jpg/440px-Standing_Hippopotamus_MET_DP248993.jpg')

```

## Documentation

The full documentation for Marqo can be found here [https://docs.marqo.ai/](https://docs.marqo.ai/).

## Warning

Note that you should not run other applications on Marqo's Opensearch cluster as Marqo automatically changes and adapts the settings on the cluster.

## M series Mac users

Marqo does not yet support the docker-in-docker backend configuration for the arm64 architecture. This means that if you have an M series Mac, you will also need to run marqo's backend, marqo-os, locally.

To run Marqo on an M series Mac, follow the next steps.

1. In one terminal run the following command to start opensearch:

```shell

docker rm -f marqo-os; docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9600:9600 -e "discovery.type=single-node" marqoai/marqo-os:0.0.2-arm

```

2. In another terminal run the following command to launch Marqo:

```shell

docker rm -f marqo; docker run --name marqo --privileged \

- p 8882:8882 --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
- e "OPENSEARCH_URL=https://localhost:9200" \

marqoai/marqo:0.0.6

```
